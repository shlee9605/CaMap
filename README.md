# Abstract

	This project is about public interest.  
	This project started to seperate non-smokers from secondhand smoke.  
	This map displays Near Smoking Zone and Trash Can, thus, non-smokers can avoid certain area  
	This app is made for koreans, using Naver Map API.  
	But, I believe you can use it in foreign country, if you get used to using Google Map API instead.
  
	I've got the area informaition from Seoul City hall,  
	And I published this App via Google Play Store
