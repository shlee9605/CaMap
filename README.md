# Abstract

This project is about public interest.

This project started to seperate non-smokers from secondhand smoke.

This map displays Near Smoking Zone and Trash Can, thus, non-smokers can avoid certain area

This app is made for koreans, using Naver Map API.

But, I believe you can use it in foreign country, if you get used to using Google Map API instead.


I've got the area informaition from Seoul City hall,

And I published this App via Google Play Store
